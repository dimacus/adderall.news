            <strong>Silicon Valley</strong> — Technology startup Robeaute's highly anticipated initial public offering has been indefinitely postponed following the emergence of classified Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) patents that allegedly give the federal government sweeping control over neural interface technologies. Multiple sources within the defense establishment confirm that an unnamed DARPA official has privately stated the government must preserve its "monopoly on mind control" and prevent private sector encroachment into cognitive manipulation technologies.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            The revelation has sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley's venture capital community, where Robeaute was valued at $12.3 billion in its most recent funding round. The company, which specializes in non-invasive brain-computer interface technology for productivity enhancement, was set to become one of the largest tech IPOs of 2025 before federal regulators intervened with previously undisclosed patent challenges.

          <p className="mb-6">
            According to leaked documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, DARPA filed a series of broad patents between 2019 and 2023 covering virtually every aspect of neural interface technology. These patents, classified under the Invention Secrecy Act, were kept hidden from public databases until Robeaute's legal team encountered them during the IPO due diligence process.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            The patents in question, designated under classification codes 3-105 through 3-847, encompass technologies ranging from basic electroencephalography signal processing to advanced machine learning algorithms for thought pattern recognition. Patent attorneys familiar with the documents describe them as "impossibly broad," covering fundamental techniques that any neural interface company would necessarily employ.
          </p>
